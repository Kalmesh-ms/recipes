Build a basic website for recipes using HTML

This is will be a recipe website by a beginner. Languages required are HTML.
Learn through creating a portfolio or project by overcoming practical problems to build website. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished. It's important to keep in my mind that this project is just build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in future to style it up with CSS.
